      <description>No one is going to beat you at being you. Find what that feels like—play to you but looks like work to others. So that you&amp;rsquo;re going to outcompete them because you&amp;rsquo;re doing it effortlessly; you&amp;rsquo;re doing it for fun.
The more you do things that are natural to you, the less competition you have. Escape competition through authenticity, by being your own self.
To be successful in two words — productize yourself.</description>

Book Link : The Pivot Year
My learnings from the book #Day 1 : Not to build a clean one-line story but to create a mosaic of experience — ever-forming, ever-evolving, ever-unfolding as whats within unravels into reality revealing at last the fragment of the universe that came to be known through you at this exact time.
Day 2 : The Golden Vortex — the space between everything you know you&amp;rsquo;re meant for and anything you had previously imagined to be.</description>

Book Link : The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles
My learnings from the book #Most of us have two lives. the life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands resistance.
What&amp;rsquo;s resistance ? Late at night have you experienced a vision of the person you might become, the work you could accomplish, the realized being you were meant to be?</description>
