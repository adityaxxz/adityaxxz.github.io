Practice this pause.\nDay 5 : There are two rivers running through us at all times, one that carries all the voices of the world, and the other , a single voice stands alone - the voice of our inner guide. Our lives begin the day we choose to follow our inner knowing, the first realization of wisdom is the recognition that there is truth fragmented everywhere. At last, the journey is not about the abandoning one in favor of the other, but knowing when it is time to listen, and to follow each.\nDay 6 : Desire is a projection outward that is proportionate to potential inward. What you are waiting on is your own willingness to accept the mountain you must climb in order to pull those desires out of the deepest parts of you and create them in the world you already inhabit.\nDay 7 : Stop trying to be good at hundred things and finally choose the one that asks you to risk, to lay your heart bare, to try again, even though you\u0026rsquo;re scared. You\u0026rsquo;re not failing coz you\u0026rsquo;re not motivated, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re not supposed to get far on a path that was never yours to walk.\nDay 8 : Living life is really just knowing how to take care of yourself, how to make home within your own skin, it\u0026rsquo;s learning how to build a simple life you are proud of. Little by little, you begins to see that life can only grow outward in proportion to how stable it is inward - That if the joy is not in the little things first,The big things wont fully find us.\nDay 9 : Whatever pain you think you are in right now cannot begin to compare to the peace that will one day come over here.\nDay 10 : The journey is not how you place down what\u0026rsquo;s being on you, but how you learn to stop picking it up.\nDay 11: Not every phase of your life will tell the same story, Our greatest dreams and our deepest fears make coexist, and the existence of one does not negate or lessen the other, that every movement that you honour where you are with complete surrender you open to the next experience live wants to offer.\nDay 12: Release yourself into the Dreamscape and follow your hearts deepest calling, as it is leading you to the actions that will continue to weave your life into the story of humanity.\nDay 13: You tell life what you want, and life tells you how to get it. when you ask for a big life you cannot keep fighting for a smaller one to stay.\nDay 14:\nDay 15:\nDay 16:\nDay 17:\nDay 18:\nDay 19:\nDay 20:\nDay 21:\nDay 22:\nDay 23:\nDay 24:\nDay 25:\nDay 26:\nDay 27:\nDay 28:\nDay 29:\nDay 30:\nDay 31:\nDay 32:\nDay 33:\nDay 34:\nDay 35:\nDay 36:\nDay 37:\nDay 38:\nDay 39:\nDay 40:\nDay 41:\nDay 42:\nDay 43:\nDay 44:\nDay 45:\nDay 46:\nDay 47:\nDay 48:\nDay 49:\nDay 50:\nDay 51:\nDay 52:\nDay 53:\nDay 54:\nDay 55:\nDay 56:\nDay 57:\nDay 58:\nDay 59:\nDay 60:\nDay 61:\nDay 62:\nDay 63:\nDay 64:\nDay 65:\nDay 66:\nDay 67:\nDay 68:\nDay 69:\nDay 70:\nDay 71:\nDay 72:\nDay 73:\nDay 74:\nDay 75:\nDay 76:\nDay 77:\nDay 78:\nDay 79:\nDay 80:\nDay 81:\nDay 82:\nDay 83:\nDay 84:\nDay 85:\nDay 86:\nDay 87:\nDay 88:\nDay 89:\nDay 90:\nDay 91:\nDay 92:\nDay 93:\nDay 94:\nDay 95:\nDay 96:\nDay 97:\nDay 98:\nDay 99:\nDay 100:\n","date":"15 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/the-pivot-year/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Author : Brianna Wiest","title":"The Pivot Year","type":"blogs"},{"content":"\r\u0026ldquo;If you find my projects useful, a star ‚≠ê would be fantastic.\u0026rdquo;\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Account Abstraction #\radityaxxz/account-abstraction\rMinimal Account Abstraction implementation on Ethereum \u0026amp; ZKSync\rSolidity 1\r0\r2Ô∏è‚É£ Stablecoin defi project #\r3Ô∏è‚É£ CryptoTracer #\rVisit the addyüîó or testüîó branch to see my commits!\nadityaxxz/CryptoTracer\rSIH.1675\rJavaScript 0\r0\r4Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Threaded Web Server #\radityaxxz/multithreaded-web-server\rBuilt a Multithreaded Web Server using Rustü¶Ä\rRust 0\r0\r5Ô∏è‚É£ FundMe Contract in foundry #\radityaxxz/foundry-fund-me\rSolidity 0\r0\r","date":"4 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"0xAdra","summary":"\u0026ldquo;If you find my projects useful, a star ‚≠ê would be fantastic.","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"Author : Steven Pressfield\nBook Link : The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles\nMy learnings from the book #\rMost of us have two lives. the life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands resistance.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s resistance ? Late at night have you experienced a vision of the person you might become, the work you could accomplish, the realized being you were meant to be? Are you a writer who doesn\u0026rsquo;t write, a painter who doesn\u0026rsquo;t paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what Resistance is.\nIf you believe in God (and I do) you must declare Resistance evil, for it prevents us from achieving the life God intended when He endowed each of us with our own unique genius.(One of the great lines)\nLook in your own heart. Unless I\u0026rsquo;m crazy, right now a still small voice is piping up, telling you as it has ten thousand times, the calling that is yours and yours alone. You know it. No one has to tell you. And you\u0026rsquo;re no closer to taking action on it than you were yesterday or will be tomorrow. You think Resistance isn\u0026rsquo;t real? Resistance will bury you.\nResistance is not a peripheral opponent. Resistance arises from within. It is self-generated and self-perpetuated. Resistance is the enemy within.\nProcrastination is the most common manifestation of resistance because its the easiest to rationalize.\n","date":"4 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/the-war-of-art/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Author : Steven Pressfield","title":"The War of Art","type":"blogs"},{"content":" An independent security researcher \u0026 developer auditing smart contracts for a living...
