It serves as a modern Sun-Tzu for the soul, addressing the internal obstacles that prevent us from achieving our goals. Bestselling novelist Steven Pressfield identifies the inner enemy we all face, provides a battle plan to overcome it, and explains how to achieve the highest level of creative discipline. This book emphasizes the resolve needed to recognize and surmount the barriers to ambition, offering tough love to inspire artists, writers, and businesspeople to realize their full potential.\nMy learnings from the book #\rMost of us have two lives. the life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands resistance.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s resistance ? Late at night have you experienced a vision of the person you might become, the work you could accomplish, the realized being you were meant to be? Are you a writer who doesn\u0026rsquo;t write, a painter who doesn\u0026rsquo;t paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what Resistance is.\nIf you believe in God (and I do) you must declare Resistance evil, for it prevents us from achieving the life God intended when He endowed each of us with our own unique genius.(One of the great lines)\n","date":"4 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/the-war-of-art/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Author : Steven Pressfield","title":"The War of Art","type":"blog"},{"content":"\r","date":"4 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"0xAdra","summary":"\r","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
