      <description>No one is going to beat you at being you. Find what that feels like‚Äîplay to you but looks like work to others. So that you&amp;rsquo;re going to outcompete them because you&amp;rsquo;re doing it effortlessly; you&amp;rsquo;re doing it for fun.
The more you do things that are natural to you, the less competition you have. Escape competition through authenticity, by being your own self.
To be successful in two words ‚Äî productize yourself.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s MEV? #It&amp;rsquo;s the value that blockchain node operators and users can extract by ordering transactions in a block in a specific order.
When a transaction is initiated, it is directed to a specific node which, instead of immediately integrating it into its block, places it into its &amp;lsquo;memory pool&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;mempool&amp;rsquo; {waiting area for transactions}. This constitutes the lower tier of workings that enable blockchain.
Suppose you&amp;rsquo;re a malicious user and want to use this to your advantage.</description>

      <description>Perpetuals Mission #1 #Perpetuals are essentially just a way for a trader to bet on the price of a certain index token without actually buying the token while enabling the trader to employ leverage. Why perpetuals? #Perpetual are named as such because a trader can keep their &amp;ldquo;perpetual&amp;rdquo; position open for as long as they&amp;rsquo;d like, or in perpetuity.
So What&amp;rsquo;s a position? #The entire protocol revolves around ‚Ä¢positions&amp;quot; that belong to traders, a position is made up of the following:</description>

Book Link : The Pivot Year
My learnings from the book #Day 1 : Not to build a clean one-line story but to create a mosaic of experience ‚Äî ever-forming, ever-evolving, ever-unfolding as whats within unravels into reality revealing at last the fragment of the universe that came to be known through you at this exact time.
Day 2 : The Golden Vortex ‚Äî the space between everything you know you&amp;rsquo;re meant for and anything you had previously imagined to be.</description>

Book Link : The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles
My learnings from the book #Most of us have two lives. the life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands resistance.
What&amp;rsquo;s resistance ? Late at night have you experienced a vision of the person you might become, the work you could accomplish, the realized being you were meant to be?</description>
