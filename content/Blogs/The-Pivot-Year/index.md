## My learnings from the book 

- <u>Day 1</u> : Not to build a clean one-line story but to create a **mosaic of experience** — ever-forming,  ever-evolving, ever-unfolding as whats within unravels into reality revealing at last the fragment of the universe that came to be known through you at this exact time.

- <u>Day 2</u> : The **Golden Vortex** — the space between everything you know you're meant for and anything you had previously imagined to be.

<!-- - <u>Day 3</u> :  -->
