## My learnings from the book 

- Day 1 : Not to build a clean one-line story but to create a **mosaic of experience** — ever-forming,  ever-evolving, ever-unfolding as whats within unravels into reality revealing at last the fragment of the universe that came to be known through you at this exact time.

- Day 2 : The **Golden Vortex** — the space between everything you know you're meant for and anything you had previously imagined to be.

- Day 3 : **Happiness** is not something that comes to you when every problem is solved and all things are perfectly in place, but in the *shining silver linings* that remind us the light of the day is always there if you slow down enough to notice.

- Day 4 : **Self-Protection** is learning how to take a pause between what you feel and how you react. __*Practice this pause*__.

- Day 5 : There are two rivers running through us at all times, one that carries all the voices of the world, and the other , a single voice stands alone - *the voice of our inner guide*. Our lives begin the day we choose to follow our inner knowing, the first realization of wisdom is the recognition that there is truth fragmented everywhere. At last, the journey is not about the abandoning one in favor of the other, but knowing when it is time to listen, and to follow each.

- Day 6 : **Desire** is a projection outward that is proportionate to potential inward. What you are waiting on is your own willingness to accept the mountain you must climb in order to pull those desires out of the deepest parts of you and create them in the world you already inhabit.

- Day 7 : **Stop trying to be good at hundred things** and finally choose *the one that asks you to risk*, *to lay your heart bare*, *to try again*, even though you're scared. You're not failing coz you're not motivated, maybe you're not supposed to get far on a path that was never yours to walk.

- Day 8 : **Living life is really just knowing** how to take care of yourself, how to make home within your own skin, it's learning how to build a simple life you are proud of. Little by little, you begins to see that life can only grow outward in proportion to how stable it is inward - That if the joy is not in the little things first,The big things wont fully find us. 

- Day 9 : Whatever pain you think you are in right now cannot begin to compare to the peace that will one day come over here.

- Day 10 : The journey is not how you place down what's being on you, but how you learn to stop picking it up.

- Day 11: Not every phase of your life will tell the same story, Our greatest dreams and our deepest fears make coexist, and the existence of one does not negate or lessen the other, that every movement that you honour where you are with complete surrender you open to the next experience live wants to offer.

- Day 12: **Release yourself into the Dreamscape** and follow your hearts deepest calling, as it is leading you to the actions that will continue to weave your life into the story of humanity.

- Day 13: **You tell life what you want, and life tells you how to get it**. when you ask for a big life you cannot keep fighting for a smaller one to stay.
