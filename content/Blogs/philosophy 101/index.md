- **No one is going to beat you at being you**. Find what that feels like—play to you but looks like work to others. So that you're going to outcompete them because you're doing it effortlessly; you're doing it for fun.  
- The more you do things that are natural to you, the less competition you have. **Escape competition through authenticity, by being your own self.**
- To be successful in two words — **productize yourself**.  
- **Much better to treat this like a search function**: find the work you want to do, or the place you want to be at, and the best time to figure this out is right now.  
- **Try to focus on the overarching problem** and try to solve that problem. If you want to be successful, ***define success*** very concretely and focus on that. In everything else, when you tend to see your mind, it becomes a problem.  
- You have one life, **don't settle for mediocrity**.  
- The **only true test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of your life**, and there are two parts to that —  
  - *One is getting what you want, so you know how to get it.*  
  - *Second, wanting the right thing—knowing what to want in the first place.* 
- Use [`secretary theorem`](https://aliabdaal.com/newsletter/the-37-rule/#:~:text=Basically%20if%20you%20knew%20you,best%2Dso%2Dfar%20candidate.)  (read about it) to pick stuff in life. Optimal time is about ⅓ or 37%.
  - The interesting thing about the secretary problem is that it's not time-based. It's not based on ⅓ of the time; it's **iteration-based** (analogy: the number of candidates or number of shots you took on goal).  
- Malcolm Gladwell popularized this idea of 10,000 hours to mastery — **but I think it's 10,000** (not actually, but some unknown number) **iterations to mastery**. It's about the number of iterations that drives a learning curve.  
- **Iterations are not repetitions**. Repetition is about repeating a thing over and over.  
  Iteration is modifying it with a learning and doing another version of it. So that's error correction. So if you’ll get 10,000 error corrections in anything, you'll be an expert at it.
